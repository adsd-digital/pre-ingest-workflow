In this repository the Archive of Social Democracy of the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung publishes scripts used in its workflow for preparing folders
for appraisal and ingest into a digital preservation system. The script collection will hopefully grow over time.
The scripts are everyday tools, created for a specific use case and only tested in this environment (currently Ubuntu 22.04). 


Currently available is:
- format-categorization.py:
  The script categorizes a DROID output according to a format-list into different categories concerning digital preservation and appraisal.
  A (nearly empty) format-list.csv ist provided which can be filled with PUIDs according to the specific archive's decision about formats.
  The few formats within the format-list only serve as examples of how to use the csv file.
